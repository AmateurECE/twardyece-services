# Maintenance of This Project

The following is a list of action items that need to be completed every so
often in order to maintain the project:

1. Audit the LDAP directory to ensure user accounts are up-to-date, removing
   user accounts as necessary
2. Ensure Python dependencies in requirements.apps.txt are up to date
3. Ensure OCI image tags are kept up to date
